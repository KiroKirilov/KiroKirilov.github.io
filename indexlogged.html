                    <p>
                        In my life, I have given a fuck about many people and many things. I have also not given a fuck about many people and many things. And those fucks I have not given have made all the difference.<br><br>

                        People often say the key to confidence and success in life is to simply "not give a fuck." Indeed, we often refer to the strongest, most admirable people we know in terms of their lack of fucks given. Like "Oh, look at Susie working weekends again, she doesn't give a fuck." Or "Did you hear that Tom called the company president an asshole and still got a raise anyway? Holy shit, that dude does not give a fuck." Or "Jason got up and ended his date with Cindy after 20 minutes. He said he wasn't going to listen to her bullshit anymore. Man, that guy does not give a fuck."
